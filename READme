For the full project, Go to "master" Branch.
Download the source code
The recommended PHP version and Admin credentials are also uploaded there

Besides, avoid the external branches named "model/view/controller" as those are only partial codes of this project and pushed in the sprints. 
To run the full project, "master" branch has everything organized in that!

Thank you
